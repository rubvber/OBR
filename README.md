## Active dSprites
Active dSprites is a simple multi-object environment with continuous dynamics and control. Objects in active dSprites are a recreation of those in the [dSprites](https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset) dataset. Objects have linear dynamics that can be perturbed by accelerations specified as "action fields". An action field is an image-sized tensor that, for each pixel, contains an (x,y) acceleration vector. Objects receive a total acceleration that is the sum of the accelerations at their visible pixels. In practice, we typically restrict ourselves to one acceleration per object. In the absence of such accelerations, objects maintain a constant velocity (i.e. there are no friction forces in the environment). Objects do not collide.

## OBR
OBR (or Object-Centric Behavioral Reasoner) is a recurrent DNN architecture for object-centric perception, action and control that is trained without supervision on raw RGB video frames. It consists of a world model component and a preference network, both of which interface with an object-structured latent representation of the environment. The world model performs perceptual inference, prediction and goal-directed planning. Perception consists of iterative amortized (variational) inference on a Gaussian Mixture model for individual video frames, linked together via a linearized dynamics model with Gaussian noise. These dynamics can be influenced by control actions that accelerate objects. The linearized dynamics model, combined with a latent representation in second-order generalized coordinates, allows for highly efficient prediction and planning, as both can be performed in closed form via linear projections. Planning requires that a goal or preferred state be supplied in the network's latent space, and this is the purpose of the preference network. It takes as input the current beliefs about object states, and outputs a predicted distribution over their preferred states, thus allowing the model to learn tasks defined by abstract rules.


### Training
OBR is implemented as a Pytorch Lightning module, which amongst other things allows for easy multi-GPU training. To train OBR's world model (with default settings) on multiple GPUs, you can use (e.g.) one of the following commands:

`python OBR_trainer.py --gpus 3 4 5 6`

`python OBR_trainer.py --gpus -4`


The first option would train on 4 gpus with indices 3, 4, 5 and 6 within your setup. The second option (note the negative sign) lets the code pick 4 GPUs automatically. For single-GPU training, use one of the following:

`python OBR_trainer.py --gpus 0`

`python OBR_trainer.py --gpus -1`

Given a trained world model, it is possible to train a preference network on top of this to learn a task. For instance:

<code>python OBR_trainer.py --gpus -4 --init_percept_net <path_to_checkpoint_file> --freeze_percept_net True --with_goal_net True \ <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; --ad_rule_goal HeartLR+TMB --ad_rule_goal_actions True --ad_num_frames 12 --ad_val_num_frames 12 \ <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; --val_predict 0 --action_frames 2 4 6 8 </code>
